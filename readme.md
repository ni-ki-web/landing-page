# Landing Page Project

This is a simple **landing page** built using **HTML and CSS** as part of the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Project Overview

The goal was to recreate a landing page using a **reference image, layout, and colour scheme** provided by The Odin Project. This project helped me practice:

- Structuring a webpage with semantic HTML
- Styling with CSS including Flexbox 
- Making layouts responsive
- Matching design visuals based on a mockup

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS

## What I learned

- Writing clean and semantic HTML
- Using CSS Flexbox for layout and alignment
- Creating responsive layouts
- Improving visual accuracy by recreating a reference design

## Next Steps *(optional)*

- Personalize the landing page with my own content (e.g., replace placeholder text/images with real content)
- Explore adding a custom colour palette and font combinations
- Add interactivity with JavaScript 

## Status

**Project Complete** - responsive layout built and visually matched the provided design.
